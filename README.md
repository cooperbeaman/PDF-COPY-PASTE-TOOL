### WARNING: SCRIPT ONLY RUNS ON WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM 
Before running pdfcp script through windows command prompt: 
First ensure the latest version of python is installed 
Install clipboard module (run "pip install clipboard" command from command prompt)
Only run script when copying quotes from pdfs (tested and confirmed working with Adobe Acrobat and Adobe Reader but should modify text copied from any pdf viewer).
Terminate script first before copying text from anywhere other than pdfs

Example usage:

1. open command prompt in directory of "C:...\PDF_Copy_Paster\scripts"
2. type the command "python pdfcp.py" or "python3 pdfcp.py" and hit <Enter>
3. follow the promts to append quotes or a carraige return (<y> + <enter> = yes; <Enter> = no)
4. Leave the command prompt window open (minimized/running in the background) while copying blocks of text from PDFs
5. press <Enter> to terminate the script when copying from elsewhere or when you want to rerun the script (repeat steps 2-4) with different options enabled/disabled
